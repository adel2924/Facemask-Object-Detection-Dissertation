# Facemask-Object-Detection-Dissertation
This repository contains code for the implementation of state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms for identifying and labeling face masks in COVID-related image datasets. The objective of this project is to select the most accurate model that requires the least amount of manual labeling. The studied models include DETR, YOLO, SSD, and R-CNN, with the final evaluation focusing on DETR, YOLOv8, and Faster R-CNN for face mask detection
